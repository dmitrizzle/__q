# __q
A short list of JS shortcuts for ES5

`__q('.selector')` - Selects an array of elements. Will need to pass [0] if you just need one (first one)
`__fire('eventName', eventData)` - Fires an event, attached to `window ` of the document
`window.addEventListener("donescrolling", function(){ console.log('user stopped scrolling'); });` - If you need to execute something when user stopped scrolling this is the way.
